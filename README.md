The below grid is a picture of an example arrangement of how the rooms could be generated.

The hero exists in a grid of randomly generated rooms (as seen above), these rooms will randomly generate 6 regular rooms, a shop room, the boss room, and the starting room. 

The idea behind this project is to have a hero that climbs a 'tower' by clearing every room and defeating the floor boss.
